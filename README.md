## Patterns Used
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture: Manages services like Player, UI, and Color Switch Spawner, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and easier maintenance.
- Service Locator Pattern: Services like Player and UI PopUps communicate via a service locator, making the system modular and flexible.
- State Machine Pattern: Manages the player color states (Purple,Red,Blue,Yellow) for seamless transitions and gameplay control.
- Generic Mono Singleton: Ensures that GameService is globally accessible with a single instance throughout the game.
- Observer Pattern: Implements Unity Actions to maintain loose coupling between systems like score updates and UI changes and Game Start/Stop.
